I am currently a **PhD candidate at Télécom Paris** (LTCI lab., IDS Department, S2A team), working on the project *REFAIR: Revisiting the Foundations of Algorithmic Fairness for Graphs*, under the supervision of **Charlotte Laclau** and **Tiphaine Viard**.  

My thesis is conducted in partnership with **Deezer Research**, where I am co-supervised by **Bruno Sguerra** and **Manuel Moussallam**.  

My research interests focus on **algorithmic fairness**, particularly in **graph-based machine learning methods**. I am especially interested in **link prediction**, with **music recommendation** being a primary application domain for my work.
